How To Run Calculator
------------------------------

1. Clone the code using command "sudo git clone https://github.com/Dj15/Calculator.git"

2. Run the command "sudo make clean" to clean the object files and Debug files.

3. This project requires shared Library Files kept at lib Folder.

4. Keep the Library at Environment Path in my case /usr/local/lib/tup/

5. Build the Library PATH(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) using command "ldconfig" or search for library using "ldconfig -p | grep operand".

6. Once done use command "sudo make". This will create Executable file in bin/ folder.
